For this project I need migrate resources ordered in a tree to a new tree instance with another order.  It could also be seen as a tree reorder process. Is there a way to describe this reordering in a programming language ?

that is not what i have been looking for.
I like to see a sort of log where one describes if a node moved a level down or up or siblings change and so on. Do you know of a standard about that?
